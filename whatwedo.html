      <p>Harvey House Work does jobs on your property and yard. This can vary between something like clearing bushes off of the property to giving the house a new paint job. We can also help you build something on your property like a shed, providing you pay for the materials.</p>
    </br>
      <p>It is as simple as that. No big company with all their equipment invading your property, just a few simple tools and it's done!</p>
    </br>
      <p>It is also done for the low price of $9.25 an hour, 9 dollars an hour below Oregon's average pay for yard workers.</p>
